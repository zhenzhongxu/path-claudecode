The kernel requires hooks, settings deny rules, and scripts beyond what the Claude Code plugin system currently supports (skills only). A plugin manifest (.claude-plugin/plugin.json) is included for forward compatibility — when the plugin system supports full project extensions, this will migrate to /plugin install.",
